# My First React Native App 

React Native Jobs

Welcome to my first React Native app from tutorial [Build and Deploy a React Native App | 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ3bGvy0WAY&t=1215s) ! This app was developed as a learning project to get started with RN mobile app development. 


## Introduction

Alongside building this application, I also learned how to:
- develop visually appealing UI/UX designs
- fetch data from an external API and integrate it
- implement search & pagination functionality
- create customAPI data fetching hooks
- write clean, organized, and maintainable code with proper architecture
- follow the best practices for React Native development
